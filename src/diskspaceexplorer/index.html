    <p>diskSpace Explorer is a professional tool, powerful, intuitive and easy to use, that allows the network professional to manage the server hard disk space and make intelligent allocation decisions for its capacity... yet it is simple enough for the average computer user at home on non-networked computers to allocate and manage hard drive space the way professionals do.</p>

It can also help you measure the space required to copy your files to CD-ROMs or floppy disks.</li>

  <li class="inv-list-item">Print or export reports containing detailed information about folders and drives or copy pie charts onto the clipboard in either metafile or bitmap format.</li>
  <li class="inv-list-item">Scan NTFS, FAT32, FAT16 and FAT12 drives. Scan local hard disks, network disks, or USB drives.</li>
